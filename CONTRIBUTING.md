# Contributing

At present this is mostly a solo project, but
external contributions are very welcome.

This is a bit of a special project, 
in part because a search engine isn't
like a text editor that you can just 
download and tinker with; and in part 
because it's as much a research project
as it is a search engine.

If you have an idea for a cool change, 
send an email to <kontakt@marginalia.nu> and
we can discuss its feasibility. 

Search is essentially a fractal of interesting
problems, so even if you don't have an idea, 
just a skillset (really any), odds are there's
something interesting I could point you to.

## Release and branches

The search engine has a release cycle of
once per 6-8 weeks, coinciding with the crawling
cycle. Where model-breaking changes and changes to
the crawler can be introduced. 

## Running and set-up

There is a complementary project, wmsa.local, which
contains scripts and instructions for running this
code base.
