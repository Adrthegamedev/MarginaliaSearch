# Array Library

The array library offers easy allocation of large [memory mapped files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) 
with less performance overhead than the traditional `buffers[i].get(j)`-style constructions
java often leads to given its suffocating 2 Gb ByteBuffer size limitation. 

It accomplishes this by delegating block oerations down to the appropriate page. If the operation
crosses a page boundary, it is not delegated and a bit slower.

It's a very C++-style library that does unidiomatic things with interface default 
functions to get diamond inheritance.

## Quick demo:
```java
var array = LongArray.mmapForWriting(Path.of("/tmp/test"), 1<<16);

array.transformEach(50, 1000, (pos, val) -> Long.hashCode(pos));
array.quickSort(50, 1000);
if (array.binarySearch(array.get(100), 50, 1000) >= 0) {
    System.out.println("Nevermind, I found it!");
}

array.range(50, 1000).fill(0, 950, 1);
array.forEach(0, 100, (pos, val) -> {
    System.out.println(pos + ":" + val);
});

```


## Query Buffers

The library offers many operations for sorting and dealing with sorted data.
The classes [IntQueryBuffer](src/main/java/nu/marginalia/array/buffer/IntQueryBuffer.java)
and [LongQueryBuffer](src/main/java/nu/marginalia/array/buffer/LongQueryBuffer.java) are used
heavily in the search engine's query processing.

They are dual-pointer buffers that offer tools for filtering data.

```java
LongQueryBuffer buffer = new LongQueryBuffer(1000);

fillBuffer(buffer);

// A typical filtering operation may look like this:
        
while (buffer.hasMore()) { // read < end
    if (someCondition(buffer.currentValue())) {
        // copy the value pointed to by the read
        // pointer to the read pointer, and
        // advance both
        buffer.retainAndAdvance();
    }
    else {
        // advance the read pointer
        buffer.rejectAndAdvance();
    }
}

// set the read pointer to the read pointer
// after this we can filter again

buffer.finalizeFiltering();
```


Especially noteworthy are the operations `retain()` and `reject()` in
[IntArraySearch](src/main/java/nu/marginalia/array/algo/IntArraySearch.java) and [LongArraySearch](src/main/java/nu/marginalia/array/algo/LongArraySearch.java).
They keep or remove all items in the buffer that exist in the range. These are used
to offer an intersection operation for the B-Tree that has in practice sub-linear run time.
