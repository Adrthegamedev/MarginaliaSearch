# marginalia.nu

This is the source code for marginalia.nu, including the search engine, 
the MEMEX/gemini server, the and the encyclopedia service. 

The canonical git server for this project is [https://git.marginalia.nu](https://git.marginalia.nu),
it is fine to mirror it on other hosts, but if you have issues or questions
that is where you want to go.

As it stands now, the project is a bit of a mess as it wasn't developed 
with the intention of going open source, a lot of tests and so on make
assumptions about the directory structure, much configuration is hard coded
and so on. Please stand by. A lot of the mess is fairly superficial.

You can also reach me at <kontakt@marginalia.nu> with any questions.
