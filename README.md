# marginalia.nu

This is the source code for marginalia.nu, including the search engine, 
the MEMEX/gemini server, the and the encyclopedia service.

As it stands now, the project is a bit of a mess as it wasn't developed 
with the intention of going open source, a lot of tests and so on make
assumptions about the directory structure, much configuration is hard coded
and so on. It's a work in progress.
