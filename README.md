# marginalia.nu

This is the source code for marginalia.nu, including the [search engine](https://search.marginalia.nu), 
the [MEMEX/gemini server](https://memex.marginalia.nu), the and the [encyclopedia service](https://encyclopedia.marginalia.nu). 

The aim of the project is to develop new and alternative discovery methods for the Internet. 
It's an experimental workshop as much as it is a public service, the overarching goal is to
elevate the more human, non-commercial sides of the Internet. A side-goal is to do this without
requiring datacenters and expensive enterprise hardware, to run this operation on affordable hardware.

The canonical git server for this project is [https://git.marginalia.nu](https://git.marginalia.nu).
It is fine to mirror it on other hosts, but if you have issues or questions
git.marginalia.nu is where you want to go.

## Important note about wmsa.local

This project has a [sister repository called wmsa.local](https://git.marginalia.nu/marginalia/wmsa.local)
that contains scripts and configuration files for running and developing the code. 

Without it, development is very unpleasant. 

While developing the code, you will want an environment variable WMSA_HOME pointing to 
the directory in which wmsa.local is checked out, otherwise the code will not run and
several tests will fail.
