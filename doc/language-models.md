# Language Models

## For Tests

Many tests require language models to work, 
download them from [https://downloads.marginalia.nu/](https://downloads.marginalia.nu/),
and put them somewhere. Then set the environment
variable ```LANGUAGE_MODELS_HOME``` to point to this directory.

Alternatively, patch ```nu.marginalia.util.TestLanguageModels``` to
default to where you've put them.
