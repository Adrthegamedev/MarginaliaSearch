    <h1>About: High Readability Wikipedia</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            This is a wikipedia client that strips away most links and almost all visual clutter
            to provide a more book-like reading experience with fewer distractions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is primarily a helpful utility for a search engine focusing on similarly text-oriented
            websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are welcome to use it for general article reading as well. This may be useful
            if you are on a low bandwidth connection, since the download size is typically reduced
            from megabytes to dozens of kilobytes.
        </p>
        <p>
            What's taken away is all the design elements that your brain would have to  filter out
            to read the text of the article. It seems as though overburdening this mental process
            causes the reader to start scanning the text instead of reading it, which is experienced
            as an inability to pay focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cleaning process is not perfect and will occasionally produce strange results,
            but significant problems should be relatively rare.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>This is a "stale" copy of wikipedia, based on an archived copy from January 2021. On the
            other hand, we used to abide printed encyclopedias that didn't update at all. </p>
        <p>
            Be aware that the cleaning strips away a lot of information, including most references,
            footnotes, quality warnings, and so forth. Refer to the original wikipedia article for
            that information.

            Don't hesitate to let me know if the website is somehow being a nuisance,
            it should respect robots.txt and reduce outgoing requests, but the format
            isn't super-standardized, so occasionally it doesn't understand every directive.
