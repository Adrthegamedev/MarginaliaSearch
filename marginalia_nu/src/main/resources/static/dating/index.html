<h1>Website Explorer</h1>
<p>
    This is a game where you explore more or less random and obscure websites around the Internet, based on the
    database of the <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/">Marginalia Search Engine</a>.
</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Press the thumbnail to visit the website.</p>
<p>Press &#10145;&#65039; to view the next website.</p>
<p>Press &#129321; to look for websites similar to the website you are seeing.</p>
<p>Press &#128256; to return to the default flavor of websites.</p>
<h3>Cookie Consent</h3>
<p>
    The game uses a <b>session cookie</b> to keep track of which websites you have been shown so that
    you do not see the same websites too repeatedly, and which websites you would like to see more of.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="button" href="/init">Consent To The Cookie And Begin</a>
</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    These websites are not manually curated. Most of them are clean, but if you do happen to see something particularly
    objectionable, please let me know by sending me an email. <tt><a href="mailto:kontakt@marginalia.nu">kontakt@marginalia.nu</a></tt>
</p>
<p>
    A less principled person would probably have plastered the page in ads, as it's a game basically revolving around
    refreshing the same page over and over. Instead I invite you to consider <a href="https://memex.marginalia.nu/projects/edge/supporting.gmi">supporting me</a>
    if you enjoy game.
