# Search Features

These are bits of search-engine related code that are relatively isolated pieces of business logic,
that benefit from the clarity of being kept separate from the rest of the
search engine code.

* [query-parser](query-parser/) contains code for parsing the user-facing query grammar.
* [result-ranking](result-ranking/) contains logic for ranking search results by relevance.
* [screenshots](screenshots/) and [random-websites](random-websites/) contains SQL queries random
  exploration mode.
