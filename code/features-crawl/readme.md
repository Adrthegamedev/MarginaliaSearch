# Crawl Features

These are bits of search-engine related code that are relatively isolated pieces of business logic,
that benefit from the clarity of being kept separate from the rest of the crawling code.


* [adblock](adblock/) - Simulates Adblock
* [pubdate](pubdate/) - Determines when a document was published
* [topic-detection](topic-detection/) - Tries to identify the topic of a website
